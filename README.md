# CISC-372-Spam-Filtering
We are the students from Queen's University and tries to figure out the solution to spam emails problem.
Solutions to the problem includes lazy learning methods: Naive Bayes Classifier, KNN Classifier, and eager learning methods: SVM Classifier , CNN and RNN, pre-trained word embeddings(GloVe) is also applied to see if there would be any improvements. The dataset is on the 'release' tag which origins from the Enron-Spam Dataset：http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/       We aggregate the data from 6 sets and form a whole with 36609 mails labelled with 0,1, represent ham or spam, repectievly.
20% of the data is sampled as testing set, without replacement, both train and testing set have similar distribution of ham and spam mails(around 55%/45%). The accuracy of each model would be evaluated with some further discussions.
